# FibUhr

The time can be read as follows:
* The squares are assigned a weighting according to their side length.
* the page lengths are 1,1,2,3 and 5
* Since this is the beginning of the Fibonacci episode, this is also the reason for their name
* Now the decimal numbers bon 1 to 12 can be displayed
* the times are for a.m. and p.m are the same

Now one can get the time by summing up the valence of the squares. The colors mean

* RED: sum of hours
* Green: sum of minutes * 5
* Blue: sum of both
* White: unused
